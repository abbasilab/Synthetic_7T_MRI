# 7T MRI Synthesization from 3T Acquisitions
[ðŸ”— View on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/YYYY.NNNNN)

This repository contains PyTorch model implementations for generating synthetic T1-weighted 7T MRIs from T1-weighted 3T MRI inputs. The models implemented are V-Net, Perceptual V-Net, V-Net-GAN, WATNet-2D, and WATNet-3D.

## Requirements

To install requirements:
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Usage example

``` 
        python run_vnet.py -i 'path_to_input_file(folder)'  -o 'folder_to_save_output_file(folder)' -c 'path_to_model_weight'
```

* Please make sure the input images meet the following criteria:
  - Nifti file
  - T1-weighted 3T image
  - Brain stripped (provide mask files as an optional input under ```-m``` if the image is not brain stripped.)

### Training

* The training parameters should be specified in ```config/params.json```.
* Place paired dataset in ```data/```,and update the dataset filepaths in ```config/params.json```.
* To initiate training, run ```src/scripts/Run_model.py```

### Data Augmentation

* The script for data augmentation is ```src/scripts/data_augmentation.ipynb```
* Transformed datasets are saved under ```data/```

### Pretrained Weights

* Pretrained weights for the base V-Net model can be found on [ðŸ”— Box](https://ucsf.app.box.com/s/yekgjj3wvuih34n6zmcnnr9ji3p2uhng)
