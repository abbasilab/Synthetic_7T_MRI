# 7T MRI Synthesization from 3T Acquisitions
[ðŸ”— View on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/YYYY.NNNNN)

This repository contains PyTorch model implementations for generating synthetic T1-weighted 7T MRIs from T1-weighted 3T MRI inputs. The models implemented are V-Net, Perceptual V-Net, V-Net-GAN, WATNet-2D, and WATNet-3D

## Requirements

To install requirements:
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

* To run the model, use the run_vnet.py script under the eval folder. 
* Please make sure the input images are:
        - nifti file
        - T1-weighted 3T image
        - brain stripped (mask files are an optional input, but the model has no innate ability to perform brain extraction. A brain mask should be provided if the input MRI is a whole head image.)

### Training

* The training parameters should be specified in ```config/params.json```.
* Place paired dataset in ```data/```,and update the dataset filepaths in ```config/params.json```.
* To initiate training, run ```src/scripts/Run_model.py```

### Data Augmentation

* The script for data augmentation is ```src/scripts/data_augmentation.ipynb```
* Transformed datasets are saved under ```data/```

### Pretrained Weights

* Pretrained weights for the base V-Net model can be found at https://ucsf.app.box.com/s/yekgjj3wvuih34n6zmcnnr9ji3p2uhng
