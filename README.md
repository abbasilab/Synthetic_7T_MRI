# Synthetic_7T_MRI
This repository contains PyTorch model implementations for generating synthetic 7T MRIs from 3T MRI inputs. The models implemented are V-Net, WATNet-2D, and WATNet-3D

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

The training parameters should be specified in ```config/params.json```.
